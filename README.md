<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This code will load the IMDB dataset, preprocess it by padding sequences, build a SimpleRNN model, train it, evaluate its performance, and plot the training history.

The purpose of the project is to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using a SimpleRNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text, in this case, movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The project aims to train a SimpleRNN model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their sentiment. This involves preprocessing the text data, building and compiling the SimpleRNN model, training it on the training dataset, evaluating its performance on the test dataset, and visualizing the training history to analyze the model's learning behavior. Ultimately, the goal is to create a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of movie reviews.
